### Deliverables
**1. [Background Research & Research Questions](https://github.com/Abdulelah01/EUREKA/blob/master/BackgroundResearch%26RQs/BR%26RQ_BackgroundResearch%26RQs.md)**

This process creates “a social and economic boost to poverty-stricken rural communities through pollination services and the sustainable harvesting of Elephant Friendly Honey.” During this study, researchers are able to identify and record hundreds of pollinator and which flower type that each pollinator visits, and document the trends and distribution patterns of a variety pollinators, including honeybees Recent Pollinator Trends Many organizations within in Nebraska have taken on conservation projects around pollinator health.
Researchers in this type of study may gather data by reviewing historical records, performing field observations, performing experiments, measuring the effects of environmental differences, and/or making phylogenetic, the evolution of a particular group of organisms, assessments.
Researchers in this type of study may gather data by reviewing historical records, performing field observations, performing experiments, measuring the effects of environmental differences, and/or measuring the effects of spring climates.

**2. [Project Plan](https://github.com/Abdulelah01/EUREKA/blob/master/Project_Plan.md)**

Being an agile group, we want to allow for unforeseen issues and adjust our work plan as needed.
The contributor column contains the team member that is responsible for completing the task.
The completion date column can signify two things: when the task should be completed by or when the task was completed by.
The tasks column contains the tasks that we believe need to be done to meet the deliverable.


**3. [Audience Profile](https://github.com/Abdulelah01/EUREKA/blob/master/AudienceProfile/AudienceProfile.md)**

Audience profiling can help to determine the goal of the product by determining to whom the product should be marketed.
Audience profiling should be completed during product development to make sure the product will fit a certain audience.
companies need to have goals in mind when they are selling a product. 

**4. [Data Cleaning Documentation](https://github.com/Abdulelah01/EUREKA/blob/master/DataCleaning/DataCleaning.md)** 

The Excel spreadsheet was composed of six sheets, Site, Visit, Veg (Vegetation), Macro, Seed and Species Attributes.

**5. [Progress Meeting](https://github.com/Abdulelah01/EUREKA/blob/master/MeetingNotes.md)** 

Run the stats behind native vs nonNative failure rates Seed Vendor failure rates Site failure rates, then relates previous cover data.

**6. [R Script](https://github.com/Abdulelah01/EUREKA/blob/master/Rscripts/Rscripts.md)** 

In this section we covered how to extract data from the datasheet we were provided  

**7. [R Plots](https://github.com/Abdulelah01/EUREKA/blob/master/RPlots/Rplot.md)** 

Versus Plots This versus plot does shows the differences between floral coverage of native and non-native plant species, however since both plots are such a small variation of coverage values it does not show anything very conclusive Plant Species Coverage Density Versus This versus plots shows the differences between plant species coverage of native and non-native plant species.
The plot shows an expected decreasing density, with very few at the largest coverage value of Native Floral Coverage Density This plot shows the density of the floral coverage values for native plant species.
Research Question This plot shows a side by side look at the density of plant species coverage for native and non-native plants.
This means that more native plants were recorded as established than non-native plants Plots showing the conservatism of coefficient specific to the filed_ID Gage11018A Analysis: Based on this plot we could say that the maximum number of species count fall under the coefficient of conservatism of 4 where the coefficient value ranges from 0 to 7.
Non-Native Floral Coverage Density This plot shows the density of the floral coverage values for non-native plant species.
Non-Native Plant Species Coverage Density This plot shows the density of the plant species coverage values for non-native plant species.
