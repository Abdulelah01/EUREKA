_We will use Zoom to present to your clients: dress up nice and put on a good show! Additional specifics and requirements related to presentation format will be discussed in class; plan to spend time rehearsing so that your presentation falls within the time limits. Prezi is not permitted.

You will need to address the following points:

why the questions are important,
who should care,
where the data come from,
how you used it,
the limitations of the data,
your interpretation of the data, and
what decisions should be made based on your analysis.

You should design the presentation to be as persuasive as possible to appeal to your client, but without being misleading.

In addition to delivering your presentation in class, submit a URL on Canvas for any materials you use (e.g., slides), which should also be included in your Git package.
