## Research Question
How does the the factor of being native versus non-native affect the plant growth of species in the fields tested?
### Plots
![Plant Species Coverage Density Versus](PlantSpeciesCoverageDensityVersus.png)
### Interpretation
This plot shows a side by side look at the density of plant species coverage for native and non-native plants. The plant species coverage is a measure of how established the plant is within a quadrant. The higher the value the better the growth. The plots show that the native plants have a higher density in the coverage values 1:4. This is showing that the early establishment of native plants is stronger than non-native plants. Values 5 and 6 show very similar densities between native and non-native plant species but the density is very small for each.
