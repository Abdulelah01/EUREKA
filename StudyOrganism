### Role of Pollinators in Ecosystem

Pollinator could be anything which helps in transmission of pollen from stamen (male part of the flower) to stigma (female part of the flower) in flowering plants. There are some plants which are self-pollinating. But majority of them are pollinated by the insects and small animals such as bees, butterflies, bats, wasps, moths, beetles and birds. The pollen grains in the flower sticks to the pollinators, when they have contact with flowering plants for food, nectar or shelter. In this way the pollinators transport the pollens unknowingly from one plant to other plant and helps in plant fertilization.

Pollination is mutually beneficial to plants and pollinators. 75% – 80% of flowering plants are pollinated by insects and animals. Pollination helps the plant get fertilized and produce flowers, fruits and seeds. In turn pollinators get nectars and other minerals from plants. Pollination helps in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Plants are the primary part of the terrestrial ecosystem, it provides shelter, nesting and habitat for different birds and animals. In order to maintain a diverse natural ecosystem, we need plants, this could be achieved only by maintaining a healthy pollinator across the world. Pollinators are considered as the essential element in the global food production.

Apart from providing food and shelter, pollination has some other environmental benefits such as purifying the water, providing clean air and preventing soil erosion. Pollinators are considered as the key factor for plant reproduction. Pollination results in increased number of flowering plants, which produces oxygen by utilizing the carbon dioxide. This oxygen is the essential life component for humans and animals. Plants can prevent soil erosion by holding the soil through their roots. Plants also helps in retaining the water content in the soil and returns the moisture to the atmosphere which results in rain.

An interesting fact is that the shape, structure, color and type of the flower vary depending upon the type of pollinator that visits the flowering plant. This is called as pollinator syndrome and it helps in predicting the pollinator type which will aid the successful reproduction of the flowering plant.

### World of pollinators

![Pollinator Partnership]()

| Pollinators|Pollinating Varities|
|:------------|:----------|
|Hummingbirds|Plants having tubular red, yellow and orange flowers.|
|Moths & Bats|Nocturnal blooms with heavy fragrance and large amount of diluted nectar.|
|Butterflies|Since they cannot feed while flying, they select flowers based on the shape. |
|Bees|Efficient Pollinators, Focus on one specific flower at a time.|
|Beetles|Fragrant flowers which is large and bowl shaped.|
|Flies|Putrid smelling blossoms.|
|Wasps|Co evolved in fig plants, 900 species of fig plants with own species of wasps in it.|

Among all pollinator’s bees are considered as the excellent pollinators because they spend majority of their lifetime in collecting pollen and nectar. The bees collect the pollen from the plants through the electrostatic force, it will be focusing on particular kind of flower at a time, which helps in pollen transfer between the same species of plants. Due to usage of pesticides and increasing urban landscape over last half century resulted in declined bee population and mysterious disappearance of enormous bees.
