_Your full Git package documents all the work underlying your project, and will be graded much more closely than other deliverables. You will create a directory in your repository that includes, at a minimum, the following content:

Brief but descriptive Readme.md that includes a license for your work, the names of the team members, and an overview of package contents, along with the proofreaders’ sign-off statement,
Fully commented HTML document produced with R Studio that integrates your R Script and R Plots drafts, which includes:
• Data cleaning documentation and/or scripts, including data source location,
• Overview-level script and results for basic stats analysis and visualizations that appear in the presentation and written summary,
Fully commented, comprehensive analysis and plotting script in R,
Audience profile in Markdown
A written summary (2000 - 2500 words) as HTML that includes:
• Your audience and the decisions your analysis targets (incorporate any components from your background research that you need to support this),
• Brief description of the source data and processing (up to a paragraph each),
• Overview summary of answers to your research questions with supporting plots and
statistical results:
– 2–4 figures (plots) from your analysis, generated with R,
– Your interpretations of the plots (up to a paragraph each),
– A persuasive argument for a decision your specified audience should make based on
your results,
• A word count at the end, not including references, and
• All relevant references, e.g., data sources and background information.
Presentation slides in PDF, and
A brief Markdown document summarizing contributorship to the individual deliverables for the entire project (who did what), which should be fairly consistent with Git version history, and a changelog that describes the updates made based on feedback on the draft audience profile, cleaning documentation, data description, analysis, and plots.
In short, it should include updated versions of all of your other deliverables (the work plan may be omitted) and translate your presentation to a written format, along with a description of how team members contributed to the project. The goal is generating a replicable analysis presented as a polished final product that is well organized and easy to understand, and which can be delivered to your client for their use following the conclusion of your project.

Any additional specifications will be discussed in class, and you are encouraged to bring up questions sooner rather than later so unforeseen issues don't trip us all up._
