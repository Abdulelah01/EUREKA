## Contribution
I, Erik Eiler, worked mainly with data cleaning of Veg Data. I merged and transposed all of the Veg Data into workable and analyzable data frames. I made the plots and scripts dealing with native vs non-native plant species, and the plant families. I did background research into the Xerces Society's mission and goals. I posted the main plots that were reviewed in the Peer Review. Lastly, I worked on part of the summary and finishing up the last plots needed for the final submission.
