## Contribution
I, Erik Eiler, worked mainly with data cleaning of Veg Data. I merged and transposed all of the Veg Data into workable and analyzable data frames. I made the plots and scripts dealing with native vs non-native plant species, and the plant families. I did background research into the Xerces Society's mission and goals. I posted the main plots that were reviewed in the Peer Review. Lastly, I worked on part of the summary and finishing up the last plots needed for the final submission. 

I, Anitha contributed on Rscipts and Rplots, worked with the native and non native plant species data which was cleaned and merged by Eric. I did the background research on the Study organism and Phenomenon. Also,did statistical analysis on the same. Finally I worked on integrating the data cleaning content with R scipts and Rplots for the git package submission.
