# Background Research & Research Questions
## Organization’s Mission
“The Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation is an international nonprofit organization that protects the natural world through the conservation of invertebrates and their habitats.” The name Xerces is based off of an extinct butterfly, Xerces Blue. This extinction was the first known in North America due to human activities. “The Xerces Society’s core programs focus on habitat conservation and restoration, species conservation, protecting pollinators, contributing to watershed health, and reducing harm to invertebrates from pesticide use.” 
### Project Mission
My project team is mainly focusing on the data from the protecting pollinators program. The core focus of protecting pollinators is conserving their habitats and attracting native pollinators. “The ecological service they provide is necessary for the reproduction of over 85% of the world’s flowering plants, including more than two-thirds of the world’s crop species.” The impact of losing pollinators is monumental not to just humans but to animal life as well. “The economic value of these native pollinators is estimated at $3 billion per year in the U.S.” Therefore, not only would food from crops be in ruin but food obtained from most animals would be ruined as well. The main threats to these pollinators are habit loss, pesticide use, and introduced diseases.
