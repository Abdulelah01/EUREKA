#### Socio-Demographics

* Nebraska Native  
* Masters of Science in Ecology from University of Nebraska - Lincoln  
* Has worked in Alaska with the National Wildlife Refuge System and in Minnesota as a Canoe Guide
* Started with Xerces Society in 2017
* Collaborates with NRCS (Natural Resource Conservation Services)  
* Consults with farmers on habitat restoration  
* Advises on pollinator friendly farm management practices  
* Based in Lincoln, Nebraska  

#### Target Community

    * The pollinators are considered as the important factor for the maintenance of healthy ecosystem, therefore we could say
    * A Specific Target Community are the Pollinators
    * A General Target Community is the Ecosystem
    
 #### Technical Skills
 
 * Knowledge and experience in Microsoft Excel, analytical and visualization tools like R, SPSS, Tableau and MYSQL.
 * Knowledge in Statistical Methods and calculations.
 * Knowledge on the site to be analyzed (transect, quadrats), plant species, and variables used for the study.
 
 #### Organization Mission & Values
* Protect the natural world by:
   * Conserving and restoring habitats of invertebrates
   * Conserving invertebrate species
   * Contributing to the watershed health
   * Protecting the world's pollinators
   * Attracting native pollinators
   * Minimizing the harmful impact of pesticides on invertebrates
   * Xerces society mission is to protect the natural world through the conservation of invertebrates and their habitats 
   

 #### Project Expectations
 * Correlate site-level factors with plant establishment success
   * Date of Planting
   * Seed Amount
   * Seed Vendor
   * Surrounding Landscape
* Evaluate the cover of native vs non-native plant species
* Evaluate the field level average coefficient of conservatism
* Their goals are to focus on the habitat conservation and restoration, species conservation pollinators. 

#### Project Needs
The project needs to include answering the following questions:
* Identify any specific attributes that might have contributed to the failure of individual sites
* Does the region have any effect on the success of the planting
* Does the surrounding landscape have any effect on the success of the site
